Want to give team presenataion on AI assisted fixes recently done, below are the two examples i want to present:                â”‚
1. First issue was, customer support team reported issues on Harbor/Omega Android devices, where the VoiceCommand app is falining to call a person by name.
   1.1 The issue was the voiceservice was not able to detect the Contact names
   1.2 Issue was coming from the Nuance library, which was closed source(.jar) file and no source was available
   1.3 In order to fix the issue, decompiled the source code, but the problem was the source was fully obfuscated and not able to make sense
   1.4 Used the AI to convert the obfuscated code and genrated the overidden methods in new class which helped to solve the issue
   1.5 Gerrit fixes by AI: http://10.15.1.119:8080/c/X530/qssi/platform/vendor/unc/+/7792

2. Second instance where AI helped was,
   2.1 In Omega Android device we had several platform apps which have been originally developed for XP5 project, 
and later ported to Harbor, Omega etc., over the period several SDK APIs are deprecated.
   2.2 As an example used CLI AI agent to update the deprecated APIs for Talkback app,
   2.3 AI identified several deprecated APIs and oudated practices as shown in image.png
